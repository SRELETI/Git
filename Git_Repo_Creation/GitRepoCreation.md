##Git Repository can be created in two ways:

	1. Creating a repo using "git init" command. This creates a empty git repo.
	2. Creating a repo by cloning existing repo, using the "git clone" command. 

######Different protocols supported by Git:

**Git:** Git protocol doesn't provide any authentication, apart from what git provides.

**HTTPS:** provides authentication. Most popular. To push, the user has to authenticate by entering the password. It also allows anonymous pull.

**SSH:** Most servers have it setup already. It authenticates using keys instead of password. Push and pull will be done after authentication. Anonymous pulls are not allowed. 

**Local:** Can be used, if the Git Server and the users, both save to a network file system.
